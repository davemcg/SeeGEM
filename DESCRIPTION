Description: This package contains a series of scripts to query a GEMINI 
  database (an integrated database framework to annotate and query a vcf) and 
  import likely pathogenic results into R. This data can then be decorated by 
  adding hyperlinks and assigning color; this is all knit into an interactive
  html document, which can be used in a modern web browser. It is also easy
  to integrate peddy quality control results into the SeeGEM output to 
  efficiently identify samples which have technical issues.
