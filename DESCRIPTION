Description: An interactive html document highlighting interesting DNA variants is
  output with this package. SeeGEM takes data from a 'GEMINI' 
  database (an integrated database framework to annotate and query a vcf) and then 
  decorates the DNA variants by 
  adding hyperlinks and assigning color. Alternatively, a VCF can be used an input,
  but it cannot be decorated. This is all knit with an included R
  markdown template into an interactive html document, which can be used in a 
  modern web browser. It is also easy to integrate 'peddy' quality control results 
  into the SeeGEM output to efficiently identify samples which have technical issues.
