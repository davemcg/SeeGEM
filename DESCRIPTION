Description: This package has a series of scripts to call GEMINI (an integrated 
  database framework to annotate and query a vcf) and import likely pathogenic
  results into R as a data frame. This data can then be decorated by adding 
  hyperlinks and assigning color; this is all knit into an interactive
  html document.
